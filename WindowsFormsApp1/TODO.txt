1) Load/Scope

Need to think about how to separate these.
If you load -> what is loaded. If we load all the header what about current device status
e.g. load a 2 device file, when only 1 device connected?
Do we override the current state?
When you run scope it needs to know the number devices.


>Load could automatically scope external files to separate data
>Scope could only work with most recent acquisistion.

If we mix them problems.
