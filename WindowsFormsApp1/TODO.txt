mapping is from local file, switch top setup data.

Currently other info extract from setup.

NOTE update default!
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//Just acknowledge a convertion stage in Scope for now!
Standardise DATA format! See scope format. Why not use this throughout!

DATA format problem:

DATA concats into:
Device1 => data list1 
Device2 => data list1 

-> converted into SCOPEDATA
Tick1 => {dev1:ch1, ch2, ch3,...,dev2: cha1,..., devN:chaM}
Tick2 => {dev1:ch1, ch2, ch3,...,dev2: cha1,..., devN:chaM}

-> save

-> scope needs this format.

???????????????????????????????????
???Any reason for GetData not to generate this format???
???????????????????????????????????



1) Load/Scope

Need to think about how to separate these.
If you load -> what is loaded. If we load all the header what about current device status
e.g. load a 2 device file, when only 1 device connected?
Do we override the current state?
When you run scope it needs to know the number devices.


>Load could automatically scope external files to separate data
>Scope could only work with most recent acquisistion.

If we mix them problems.
